# Thomson Travel - Web Design Project


## Website overview:
This website was created for the the new online travel company Thomson travel. 
It was created to allow customers to simply and quickly search for there next city break location. and then allowing the customer to narrow there search down to the most top rated hotels,restaurants or tourist attractions.
if the customer finds a location that they like then can book direct from thr sites trusted travel partner, or complete an enquiry form to find out more information if required. 


## Website functionality:
The website is fully functional on desktop and smaller screens with the same content visible on all. 
The navigation bar is fully functional on all screen sizes using a compressed version on smaller screens.
There is a fully functioning google map with an autocomplete section for choosing location which will change the location on the map when filled in.This was achieved by using the google maps API for rendering the map and the google places API for the autocomplete section. 
the user will then have the ability to narrow there search in the chosen location to either hotels, restaurants or tourist attractions using the navigation buttons below the map.
these buttons will change the map markers on the map depending on the selected button.
The function of the buttons was achieved using javascript to change the search parameters for each button. 
if the site user finds a desired location suitable, then they can be directed to the sites booking partner using the "book now button".
if they still have questions then they can complete the enquiry form at the bottom of the page.
The form is not fully functional and will not send details to a database or inform any site admins that a form has been filled in, its purely for demonstration purposes at this stage. 




## User design experience
To view my user design experience please visit the User design experience folder where i have documents for strategy,scope and structure, and skeleton.

## Technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* GITHUB
* GIT
* Google chrome development tools
* Google Fonts
* Google maps API
* Fontawesome 
* Javascript
* Jquery
* Webstorm IDE

## Deployment
The website was coded on webstorm IDE,I used a local GIT repository for version control committing every so often once i made changes or additions to my code.
once I had done committed it locally I then pushed it to my online repository in GITHUB.I completed this action through out the project to maintain a high standard of version control.
Once pushed to the online GITHUB repository i then made the site live using Github pages, the live site can be found here - https://cthoms1993.github.io/ThomsonTravel/

## Testing
The site was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome development tools.
It was tested on landscape and portrait mode on Google pixel 2, Google pixel 3, Galaxy S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop.
The Google map API , and javascript buttons for narrowing the search terms where tested locally and remotely as was the enquire here modal. 
For future improvement i would like to have the map tear drop markers match the colour of the selection buttons.
JS was tested and validated using JShint. 

##Bugs 
The navigation menu when on smaller screens does not auto-collapse, for future versions i would fix this. 



## Credits
I have to give credit to the code institute course material for guiding me through the Google maps api set-up, 
and to google tutorials for the google places API tutorial which helped me with my autocomplete and search buttons
The modal I have used for the contact me section is the modal from the whisky drop mini project within the course material.
